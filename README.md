# Credit-Card-Default
This is machine learning predictive model for a credit card company. They have brought us a dataset that includes some demographics and recent financial data (the past six months) for a sample of 30,000 of their account holders. This data is at the credit account level. This model will accept demographics and historical data as input and predict whether an account will default next month.
